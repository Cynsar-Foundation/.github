## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Cynsar Foundation a non profit entity, an experimentation power house where experiments like "How can we resolve conflicts using technology?", "What are new ways of incentivising honest behaviours to those who are helping reducing Carbon emissions?" , "What are the new models of energy in world could be invented?". All of these questions require collaboration on various disciplines involving various forms of experiments that are conducted in ever changing dynamics. These dynamics are governed with conditions coming from individuals. We aim to study these changes , and resolve with various modalities.

## Why now?

Human attention is limited, we want to work on research that brings out the best for individuals.
